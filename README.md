# Blood Status.

This project is a part of the bootcamp at [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com/).  

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro
The project "Blood Status" aims to analyze how many Characters are pure blood and human in  Slytherin house.


### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Data exploration/descriptive statistics
* Data processing/cleaning
* Hypothesis Testing


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Jupyter
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Statsmodels

### Metadata

* **client_id:** Every client’s unique ID.
* **variation:** Indicates if a client was part of the experiment.
* **visitor_id:** A unique ID for each client-device combination.
* **visit_id:** A unique ID for each web visit/session.
* **process_step:** Marks each step in the digital process.
* **date_time:** Timestamp of each web activity.
* **clnt_tenure_yr:** Represents how long the client has been with Vanguard, measured in years.
* **clnt_tenure_mnth:** Further breaks down the client’s tenure with Vanguard in months.
* **clnt_age:** Indicates the age of the client.
* **gendr:** Specifies the client’s gender.
* **num_accts: **Denotes the number of accounts the client holds with Vanguard.
* **bal:** Gives the total balance spread across all accounts for a particular client.
* **calls_6_mnth:** Records the number of times the client reached out over a call in the past six months.
* **logons_6_mnth:** Reflects the frequency with which the client logged onto Vanguard’s platform over the last six months.

## Project Description
The project analyzes how many characters are pure blood and human in Slytherin house, categorized by species and blood status. Data is sourced from api potterdb and kaggle.

### Questions and Hypotheses:

1.  **Blood Status Hypothesis:**  "The hypothesis suggests that approximately 70% of individuals in the dataset are 'Pure-blood', based on the prevalent occurrence of this status."
-- Status: [Not confirmed]
2. **Species Hypothesis:**  "The hypothesis suggests that the dataset predominantly comprises individuals of the 'Wizard' species, inferred from the prevalence of magical blood statuses like 'Pure-blood' and 'Half-blood'." 
-- Status: [Not confirmed]

-- **Blockers and Challenges:**

* Ensuring data quality and consistency.
* Dealing with missing or incomplete data.

### Conclusions 

1. Based on the provided data, the hypothesis that approximately 70% of individuals in the dataset are 'Pure-blood' was not confirmed. The actual percentage of 'Pure-bloods' is lower than the initial estimate.
Halfblood                   45.79%
Pureblood                   42.99%
2. "The hypothesis is not confirmed as the dataset comprises a significant proportion of 'Human' entries alongside 'Ghost', indicating a diverse population beyond the 'Wizard' species."
